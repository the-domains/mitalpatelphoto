title: "After our visit to Thailand, we came to India. I've been wanting to shoot some of the iconic spots here, and was lucky to catch the Gateway of India for sunrise - with not one person in my way. In a country of 1.2 billion people, that is pretty amazing. Enjoy! #IncredibleIndia #India #Mumbai #GatewayofIndia #Bombay"
